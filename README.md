# Node.js API using TypeScript

## Introduction
This Node.js API project, developed using TypeScript, serves as a foundation for building robust backend applications. It includes essential middleware for handling requests, enabling CORS, parsing cookies and bodies, and compressing responses. The project is designed to be a starting point for various web applications.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:

### Dev Dependencies
- @types/body-parser: TypeScript type definitions for the body-parser middleware.
- @types/compression: TypeScript type definitions for the compression middleware.
- @types/cookie-parser: TypeScript type definitions for the cookie-parser middleware.
- @types/cors: TypeScript type definitions for the cors middleware.
- @types/dotenv: TypeScript type definitions for handling environment variables.
- @types/express: TypeScript type definitions for the Express.js framework.
- @types/lodash: TypeScript type definitions for the Lodash utility library.
- @types/mongoose: TypeScript type definitions for the Mongoose ODM.
- dotenv: A zero-dependency module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- nodemon: A development tool that monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server.
- ts-node: TypeScript execution and REPL for Node.js.
- typescript: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types.
  
### Production Dependencies
- body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- compression: Middleware for compressing responses before sending them to the client.
- cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookies attached to the client's request.
- cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express.js.
- express: The Express.js web application framework.
- lodash: A utility library for working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
- mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

### Testing
